# CS 245 (Fall 2023) - Assignment 3 - IRoadTrip

In the IRoadTrip.java file hash maps are used to store the data from the three files. 
I tried to hard code some variations in spelling for several countries.
The findPath method implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from one country to another.
It is unable to find the shortest path at the moment and only prints "[ ]". 
I was in the process of debugging but ran out of time. I think that part of the issue is the reading 
the data files into the hash maps.
